title: Spring Overload
---

I made up my mind in the beginning of this year that I would like to finish my Master this year. So I took 2 courses this Spring. Another thing I tried was to socialize normally as if I don't have this extra commitment. It wasn't easy as I might have burnt out last time when doing 2 courses concurrently.
