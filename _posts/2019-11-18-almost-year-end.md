I've a feeling that, especially for my master course, no matter how hard it seems at the very beginning, once you start the progress, it no longer feels the same.

### Work - OCBC AI Lab

Last year when I was attending Nuno's class on Neogtiation, one of the projects was 10 No's. You have to get 10 rejections for the same task, and Nuno said you would soon find out how hard it is to get rejection. That project eventually landed me in OCBC AI Lab.

I left Wego at 31st Jul and joined OCBC 3rd Aug, 2019. Basically didn't take a break. There are definitely pros & cons. Now I can focus on machine learning projects, not bothering with some BI stuff like making dashboards. However, I no longer have the privilege for doing things all on the cloud.

These are the projects I'm currently working on:

* Chatbot
* Cheque OCR
* Card Fraud


### Study - Georgia Tech - M.S. CS

During the last days in Wego, apart from Nuno's class, I've also got my GMAT score (700). It wasn't that high but enough for me to start applying some schools. In the end, I didn't try to apply MBA program but instead several part-time master courses. I chose Master of Science in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, because other programs seem care more about charging high fees. This program [OMSCS](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) seems to be the most afforable choice while the quality seems great from reviews.

The specialization I decide to do is Machine Learning, which is a natural choice since I've been doing it for years. The details of each course I would elaborate on future posts. But here is the general plan:

Course | Difficuty | Semester
--- | --- | ---
[CS7638 Artificial Intelligence for Robotics](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7638-artificial-intelligence-robotics) | `Hard` | 19'Spring
[CS7646 Machine Learning for Trading](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7646-machine-learning-trading) | `Medium` | 19'Summer
[CS6476 Computer Vision](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6476-computer-vision) | `Hard` | 19'Fall
[CS6300 Software Development Process](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6300-software-development-process) | `Easy` | 19'Fall


### Side tracks

I finished most of the specializations on Coursera while I was with Wego. A bit too much when I'm looking back now. This year I stopped Coursera since I'm already on my master. However, I went back to school to take CS6101 for 2 sems. It was a really difficult course. First semester NLP following Stanford's [CS224N](http://cs224n.stanford.edu/) and the second one Deep Reinforcement Learning following UC Berkeley's [CS285](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/).


### Others

I believe every now and then you should stop and think about long term goals.

### Travel

I need to list it separately since I've been spending too much on this category.
