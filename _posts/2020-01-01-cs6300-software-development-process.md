First of all, this is an easy course even for people like me with no prior Java experience. My final grade should be around 97%.
The course itself is great, containing many key concepts in software engineering. It even worth revisiting after the semester end. Syllabus shown [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4CU0LK-qoNywol7zeAp8WulaDf33IAAR05nI9bteeo/edit).

Also, I learned how to use **IntelliJ** and **Android Studio** for the semester projects. That's a nice start since I always want to embeded tensorflow.js into an Android to build a ML based simple app. The most interesting experience I got from this course is to work distantly with 3 other teammates from the states. It's definitely a culture shock. Basically the whole project is done asynchronously. Now I understand with the highly developed workflow, it's totally possible to work remotely. Cutting off unnecessary meetings may not be a bad idea to boost productivity.

Finally, this might be a common problem for this master course. I need to consolidate information from all channels: Slack, Piazza, YouTube for relavant videos, and so on. The lecture itself is very interesting but the assignment will often take some extra efforts.

Finally, this is the recommended resources for this course:
